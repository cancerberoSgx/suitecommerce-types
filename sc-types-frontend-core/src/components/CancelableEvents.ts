 * Cancelable events adds canceling functionality to the Observer pattern so Listeners can notify the Subject to cancel the actual action. 
 * 
 * Particularly, in SuiteCommerce extension APIs, for each action, two different events are triggered, one *before* the action happen and other *after* the action happen. In the case of *before* events, listeners can cancel the execution of the actual  action by throwing an Error or by returning a rejected {@link Deferred} instance.
